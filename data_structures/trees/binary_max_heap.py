"""
    - Heaps are type of tree which are always the complete binary tree meaning there should not be any nodes left
    - There are 2 types of Heaps: Maxheap and Minheap
        - Maxheap: a given node is always GREATER than all its descendant nodes
        - Minhead: a given node is always SMALLER than all its descendant nodes
    - Duplicates are allowed in Heap contrary to Binary tree where duplicates are not allowed
    - Heaps are represented mostly as an Array in most algorithms
    - Formula to represent heap in an array is:
        node = i
        left_node = 2 * i
        right_node = (2*i) + 1
    - In binary heap, elements are inserted from left to right
    - Heap is not useful for searching purposes
    - Height of Binary Heap is always Log N (meaning it won't increase un-necessarily"
    - getMax(): It returns the root element of Max Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
    - extractMax(): Removes the maximum element from MaxHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n)
      as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
    - insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree.
    If new key is smaller than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise,
    we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
